## Description

I made a program in Python, using Tkinter as user interface that allows to reproduce a text entered by the user in voice. The user will enter by the input of this program any message, then he will have to choose a voice that reproduces what he wrote, by default it only brings 2 voices, one in Spanish and another in English. Once this is done the user will touch the Listen button to play the message and listen to it.

## Feel free to edit my code

You can add more voices. The format of this voices are {key:value}, you can choose the name of the key but the value must be the voice.

```
voices_list = {}
```
